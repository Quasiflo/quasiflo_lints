# Quasiflo's Lints for Dart & Flutter

This package includes the very pedantic & opinionated linting configuration for Dart and Flutter that all Quasiflo projects use.

## Usage

Install the package by adding the following to your `pubspec.yaml`

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  quasiflo_lints: ^0.1.0
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Include the lints by putting `include: package:quasiflo_lints/lints.yaml` in your `analysis_options.yaml`. You can still override lints as desired. Something like the following is recommended:

```yaml
# Additional information about this file can be found at https://dart.dev/tools/analysis
#* This package uses Quasiflo's standard linting rules, found at https://github.com/Quasiflo/quasiflo_lints
include: package:quasiflo_lints/lints.yaml
```
